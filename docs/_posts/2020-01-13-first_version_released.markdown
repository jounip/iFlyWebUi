First workable test version of this UI has been published. It's almost identical to old iFlyWebUi released years ago but this version is compatible with 64bit version of Prepar3D and iFly and has also been updated to use WT4 toolkit and VS 2019.

Check out [Releases][releases] for latest binary build. File all bugs/feature requests at [iFlyWebUi's GitHub repo][webui-gh].
