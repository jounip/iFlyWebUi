Start this program as adminstrator either before or after you have started P3Dv4 and selected iFly 737 plane.

In the main window you can see some logging of the program. If it says interface ok then you are ready to go. In case of error check what causes it and try again.

Some common errors:
- MS Visual redist 2019 x64 missing.
- All needed DLLs not extracted from the zip file.
- not running as admin. This seems to work at first but nothing happens when you use actual UI.

Launch your browser and go to http://localhost:8123 and you should see the UI. In this example it's used from same computer but much more fun is to use it from the tablet or similar so you can use touchscreen.
When using other that same computer you need to type correct IP address (of your simulator computer) instead of localhost.

in UI there are different tabs. Those should be self explanatory at the moment.

**FYI** GSX/Sode tab does not show the menu yet but buttons should work. (top row sends F10 and F11 so modify your GSX and SODE to accept those)
